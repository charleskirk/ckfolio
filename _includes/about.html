                    <p>A "get it done right the first time" full-stack engineer with over ten years of experience, I love to build systems that really help and impact end-users. In my experience, you can build the most performant, well-written application, but without complementary UI and UX, your users will not get the value you expect.</p>

                    <p>Iâ€™ve been known to run small-but-critical teams of engineers while still keeping my "hands dirty" by tackling some of the most tricky engineering problems presented to the business. Currently, I'm interested in freelance problem-solving in the realm of workflow, operations and modern Web Application development.</p>
